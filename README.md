Boilerplate 0.2
===============

An opinionated boilerplate build on modular snippets, including [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Respond](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond), [Require](http://requirejs.org/), [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) or [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). Supports a mobile first approach, but handles regular (non-mobile-optimized) projects as well.  
  
This is not an attempt to copy HTML5 Boilerplate, Twitter Bootstrap or any other existing boilerplates. It's a collection of snippets & best practices combined to a personal workflow. Build to be used as a framework for [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), with flexible re-usability and copy-paste-whatever-you-need in mind.
