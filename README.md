Boilerplate 0.2
===============

An opinionated mobile first workflow build on modular snippets.  
Running on SASS, COMPASS, Respond, Require and jQuery or Zepto.  
  
In no way is this an attempt to compete with HTML5 Boilerplate, Twitter Bootstrap or other existing boilerplates. It's a collection of snippets & best practices combined to a personal workflow. Created to be used as a framework in CodeKit, with flexible re-usability and copy-paste-whatever-you-need in mind.
