Boilerplate 0.2
===============

An opinionated boilerplate/workflow build on modular snippets, including [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Respond](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond), [Require](http://requirejs.org/), ... with a mobile-first approach. It's a collection of snippets & best practices combined to a personal workflow, with flexible re-usability and copy-paste-whatever-you-need in mind. Works great as a framework within [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), but that's just a personal preference.
